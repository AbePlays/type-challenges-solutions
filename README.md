# TypeScript Type Challenges

## Intro

High-quality types can help improve projects’ maintainability while avoiding potential bugs.
There are a bunch of outstanding type utility libraries may boosting your works on types, like `ts-toolbelt`, `utility-types`, `SimplyTyped`, etc, which you can already use.

We aim this project at helping you better understand how the type system works, writing your own utilities, or just having fun with the challenges.

We are also trying to form a community that you can ask questions and get answers you have faced in the actual world - they may become part of the challenges!

To get started with the challenges, follow the navigation at the top right corner.
Choose your language and take your time!

## How to Contribute

Easy!
Just spread the word that there is a project called [`type-challenges`](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges) that gives a lot of interesting challenges to scratch your head on weekends.
In case you didn’t find the solution, there is another project [`type-challenges-solutions`](https://github.com/ghaiklor/type-challenges-solutions) that explains how to solve them step by step.

If you are wondering how can you contribute to the repository, there are several ways we would like to get your help:

- Do you know Italian, Brazilian, Korean, Chinese, etc? We would like to have another language here, why not?
- Did you find a typo in existing content and want to fix it? Please do so!

For these and others matter, if you want to hack in the repository, refer to our [contributing guide](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
