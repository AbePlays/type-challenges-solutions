## What this repo is about?

This repository is a collection of Markdown files where we store the solutions for Type Challenges with explanations and comments.

## Repository structure

The structure here is pretty simple.
In the root, we have folders that are split by country codes.
In each folder there is must be a single Markdown file per challenge, named as it is named in Type Challenges repository `<level>-<challenge>.md`.

## Template

The Markdown file itself must comprise the following content:

```md
# <CHALLENGE_NAME>

<CHALLENGE_BADGES>

## Challenge

<CHALLENGE_DESCRIPTION_FROM_TYPE_CHALLENGES>

## Solution

<CHALLENGE_SOLUTION_WITH_COMMENTS>

## References

<CHALLENGE_REFERENCES_TO_READ_MORE>
```
